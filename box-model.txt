The CSS box model is a concept used in web design to describe the layout of HTML elements on a web page.
 Every HTML element can be thought of as a rectangular box, with a content area, padding, border, and margin.

The content area is the actual content of the element, such as text or an image. The padding is the space
between the content area and the border, and it can be used to add extra space around the content. The border 
is the line that surrounds the padding and content areas, and it can be styled with a variety of properties,
such as width, style, and color. Finally, the margin is the space between the border of the element and
the next element on the page, and it can be used to add extra space between elements.

The box model is illustrated using the following diagram:


+------------------------+
|           Margin         |
|                          |
|  +--------------------+  |
|  |        Border        |  |
|  |                      |  |
|  |  +----------------+  |  |
|  |  |     Padding     |  |  |
|  |  |                |  |  |
|  |  |   Content Area  |  |  |
|  |  |                |  |  |
|  |  +----------------+  |  |
|  |                      |  |
|  +----------------------+  |
|                          |
+--------------------------+

The size of an element is calculated based on the sum of its content area, padding, border, and
margin. This means that adding padding or a border to an element will increase its overall size,
which can affect the layout of the page. To avoid layout issues, the box-sizing property can be 
used to modify the box model to include or exclude padding and border from the
element's size calculation.
